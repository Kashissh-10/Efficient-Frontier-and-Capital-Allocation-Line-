# Project Title:
Efficient Frontier & Capital Allocation Line in Excel (2-Asset Portfolio)

# Overview:
Developed an **Excel-based financial model** to construct the **Efficient Frontier and Capital Allocation Line (CAL)** using two asset classes **(BSLNIFTY tracking Nifty 50 and, MAFANG tracking NYSE FANG+ TRI)**. The project applies principles from **Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT)** to illustrate optimal asset allocation strategies.

#  Key Highlights:
- Calculated **expected returns, variances, standard deviations,** and **covariance** between two assets.
- Constructed a **range of portfolio combinations** by adjusting asset weights from 0% to 100%.
- Plotted the **Efficient Frontier** and the **Capital Allocation Line (CAL)** to visualize all possible risk-return combinations.
- Identified the **tangency portfolio** **(maximum Sharpe ratio)** to highlight the **optimal risky portfolio**.
- Utilized **Excel formulas and charts** for dynamic interaction and visualization.

# Tools & Techniques Used:
- **Microsoft Excel** (Formulas, Data Tables, Charting)
- **Financial concepts**: Portfolio Theory, Sharpe Ratio, Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT), Portfolio Optimization

#  Outcome:
Created a functional and visual Excel model that clearly demonstrates the core concepts in portfolio optimization and illustrates how investors can combine assets efficiently and make informed decisions on risk vs. return. Ideal for academic, personal finance, or professional investment analysis.
